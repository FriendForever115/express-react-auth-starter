        This project sets up a Postgres, Express, React, and Node.js web-app quickly inluding user authentication with passport.js/express-session.
      </Box>

      <Box sx={{ textAlign: 'justify', my: 3 }}>
        The backend uses express, passport, express-session, pg, connect-pg-simple, helmet, and express-validator. It requires a postgres database with 2 tables with the names users and session (for saving the sessions with express-session). It uses async/await with Express to avoid callbacks and separates the "functionality" of the route handlers into controller/service/db layers.
      </Box>

      <Box sx={{ textAlign: 'justify', my: 3 }}>
        The front-end uses React, React-router v6, mui (Material UI) v5, and axios. It provides log-in/log-out from the back-end and stores the user in memory with the useState hook which could easily be refactored to use Redux, Context or another state management solution.
      </Box>
